abstract = {This paper demonstrates the multilayer structure of information in financial markets. While only 3.59{\%} of 8,190 stock/quarter pairs have single information layer, 75{\%} have two to five layers and 18{\%} have six to eight layers. We develop a clustering algorithm which determines the number of information layers with the accuracy rates between 95{\%} and 97{\%} in simulated datasets. We propose a multilayer informed trading measure, MPIN by extending the original model of Easley et al. (1996). Respective solutions for computational problems regarding MPIN estimation are also provided. PIN model's estimates on informed trading and five intermediate parameters are heavily biased for datasets with multiple information layers, while MPIN model consistently provides accurate estimates. When compared to PIN, MPIN yields substantially higher probabilities of informed trading and information event occurrence; much lower rate of informed traders for real stock/quarter pairs. We obtain daily posterior multilayer probabilities conditional on the quarterly estimates of MPIN model. Posterior probabilities derived from MPIN model are approximately two fold when compared to the ones from PIN model surrounding earnings announcements.},

@article{ErsanAlici2016,
abstract = {Computational drawbacks regarding the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the widely used PIN (probability of informed trading) measure (Easley et al., 1996) heavily distort the findings of a broad literature. Previously proposed methodologies are not free of computational biases mainly because involved problems are not treated accurately and in unity. Upon revealing the mistreatment in commonly used YZ algorithm (Yan and Zhang, 2012), we suggest a remedy for the problem of boundary solutions. Next, we differentiate and focus on another computational issue: "determination of powerful initial value sets". We develop a new algorithm that employs cluster analysis to assign multiple powerful sets of initial values for the MLE function. The analyses of the simulated quarterly datasets reflect that applying the algorithm outperforms the existing methods in accuracy. Most notably, none of the mean estimates on PIN and five intermediary parameters contains significant bias at 1{\%} level. Empirical evidence from BIST-30 Index constituents provides consistent and supportive results. In addition to accuracy concerns, consuming one-seventeenth of the time spent in YZ algorithm, the algorithm is highly applicable by researchers and professionals.},

Estimating PIN can be problematic due to corner solutions, local maxima and floating point exceptions (FPE). Yan and Zhang [J. Bank.

A grid search initial value algorithm is suggested to overcome this problem. We present a faster method for reducing the likelihood of boundary solutions and local maxima based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). We show that HAC can be used to determine an accurate and fast starting value approximation for PIN. This assists the maximum likelihood estimation process in both speed and accuracy.},

@article{Duarte09,
abstract = {Recent empirical work suggests that a proxy for the probability of informed trading (PIN) is an important determinant of the cross-section of average returns. This paper examines whether PIN is priced because of information asymmetry or because of other liquidity effects that are unrelated to information asymmetry. Our starting point is a model that decomposes PIN into two components, one related to asymmetric information and one related to illiquidity. In a two-pass Fama-MacBeth [1973. Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests. Journal of Political Economy 81, 607-636] regression, we show that the PIN component related to asymmetric information is not priced, while the PIN component related to illiquidity is priced. We conclude, therefore, that liquidity effects unrelated to information asymmetry explain the relation between PIN and the cross-section of expected returns. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We present a new procedure to estimate flow toxicity based on volume imbalance and trade intensity (the VPIN toxicity metric). VPIN is updated in volume time, making it applicable to the high-frequency world, and it does not require the intermediate estimation of non-observable parameters or the application of numerical methods. It does require trades classified as buys or sells, and we develop a new bulk volume classification procedure that we argue is more useful in high-frequency markets than standard classification procedures. We show that the VPIN metric is a useful indicator of short-term, toxicity-induced volatility. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

@article{Yan2012,

We develop an algorithm to overcome this bias and use it to estimate PIN for nearly 80,000 stock-quarters between 1993 and 2004. We obtain two sets of PIN estimates by using the factorized likelihood functions in both Easley, Hvidkjaer, and Ohara (EHO, 2010) and Lin and Ke (LK, 2011), respectively. We find that the estimate based on the EHO factorization is systematically smaller than the estimate based on the LK factorization, meaning that there is a downward bias associated with the EHO factorization. In addition, we find that boundary solutions appear with a very high frequency when the LK factorization is used. Thus it is necessary to use the LK factorization together with the algorithm in this paper. At last, we document several interesting empirical properties of PIN. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Brennan2016,
abstract = {We decompose PIN, the probability of informed trading, into good-news (PIN-G) and bad-news (PIN-B) components, which we estimate at a quarterly frequency. We first assess the validity of PIN as a measure of informed trading by calculating its association with measures of the adverse-selection component of the cost of trading. We then provide new evidence that PIN-G and PIN-B capture informed trading around earnings announcements by showing that they predict positive and negative earnings surprises, respectively. Conjecturing that investors who take long positions will be more concerned about informed selling than about informed buying since the former depresses the sale price whereas the latter raises it, we then investigate asymmetry in the pricing of private information. We find strong evidence of such asymmetry in that the effect of PIN-B on the cost of equity capital is large and highly significant, whereas the effect of PIN-G is small and statistically insignificant.},

This study shows that, although scaled data mitigates the impact of the FPE, the effectiveness of scaled data, however, appears to underperform when users adopt the unsuitable expression of the likelihood function. In contrast, the remedy of reformulating the likelihood is more stable.},

@article{Easley2010,
abstract = {We examine the potential profits of trading on a measure of private information (PIN) in a stock. A zero-investment portfolio that is size-neutral but long in high PIN stocks and short in low PIN stocks earns a significant abnormal return. The Fama-French, momentum, and liquidity factors do not explain this return. However, significant covariation in returns exists among high PIN stocks and among low PIN stocks, suggesting that PIN might proxy for an underlying factor. We create a PIN factor as the monthly return on the zero-investment portfolio above and show that it is successful in explaining returns to independent PIN-size portfolios. We also show that it is robust to inclusion of the Pstor-Stambaugh liquidity factor and the Amihud illiquidity factor. We argue that information remains an important determinant of asset returns even in the presence of these additional factors. Copyright {\textcopyright} Michael G.

However, all classification rules have only a very limited success in classifying trades executed inside the quotes, introducing a bias in the accuracy of classifying large trades, trades during high volume periods, and ECN trades.
