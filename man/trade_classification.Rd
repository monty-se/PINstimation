classify_trades(data, algorithm = "Tick", timelag = 0, ..., verbose = TRUE)

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with 4 variables in the following
order (\code{timestamp}, \code{price}, \code{bid}, \code{ask}).}

\item{algorithm}{A character string refers to the algorithm used
to determine the trade initiator, a buyer or a seller. It takes one of four
values (\code{"Tick"}, \code{"Quote"}, \code{"LR"}, \code{"EMO"}). The default value is
\code{"Tick"}. For more information about the different algorithms, check the
Details section.}

\item{timelag}{Numeric scalar. Time offset in microseconds used to select
the quote matched to each trade for the \code{"Quote"}, \code{"EMO"} and
\code{"LR"} algorithms. Interpreted in seconds as \code{timelag / 1e6}.
See \strong{Time lags vs. leads} in \code{@details} for the exact matching rule
and edge cases (start/end of sample).

Examples: \code{timelag = 5000} is a 5-millisecond lag; \code{timelag = -500000}
is a 0.5-second lead.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to the functions \code{classify_trades()}
\code{aggregate_trades()}. The recognized arguments are \code{fullreport},
and \code{is_parallel}. Other arguments will be ignored.
\itemize{
\item \code{fullreport} is binary variable passed to \code{aggregate_trades()} that
specifies whether the variable \code{freq} is returned. The default value is
\code{FALSE}.
\item \code{is_parallel} is a logical variable passed to \code{classify_trades()} that
specifies whether the computation is performed using parallel or sequential
processing. #' The default value is \code{TRUE}. For more details, please refer to the
vignette 'Parallel processing' in the package, or
\href{https://pinstimation.com/articles/parallel_processing.html}{online}.
}}

\item{verbose}{A binary variable that determines whether detailed
information about the progress of the trade classification is displayed.
No output is produced when \code{verbose} is set to \code{FALSE}. The default
value is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{frequency}{The frequency used to aggregate intraday data. It takes one
of the following values: \code{"sec"}, \code{"min"}, \code{"hour"}, \code{"day"}, \code{"week"},
\code{"month"}. The default value is \code{"day"}.}

\item{unit}{An integer referring to the size of the aggregation window
used to aggregate intraday data. The default value is \code{1}. For example, when
the parameter \code{frequency} is set to \code{"min"}, and the parameter \code{unit} is set
to 15, then the intraday data is aggregated every 15 minutes.}
}
\value{
The function classify_trades() returns a dataframe of five variables. The
first four variables are obtained from the argument \code{data}: \code{timestamp},
\code{price}, \code{bid}, \code{ask}. The fifth variable is \code{isbuy}, which takes the value
\code{TRUE}, when the trade is classified as a buyer-initiated trade, and \code{FALSE}
when the trade is classified as a seller-initiated trade.

The function aggregate_trades() returns a dataframe of two
(or three) variables. If \code{fullreport} is set to \code{TRUE}, then
the returned dataframe has three variables \verb{\{freq, b, s\}}. If
\code{fullreport} is set to \code{FALSE}, then the returned dataframe has
two variables \verb{\{b, s\}}, and, therefore, can be #'directly used for the
estimation of the \code{PIN} and \code{MPIN} models.
}
\description{
\code{classify_trades()} classifies high-frequency trading data into
buyer-initiated and seller-initiated trades using different algorithms, and
different time lags (or leads).
\cr \code{aggregate_trades()} aggregates high-frequency trading data into aggregated
data for provided frequency of aggregation. The aggregation is preceded by
a trade classification step which classifies trades using different trade
classification algorithms and time lags (or leads).
}
\details{
\strong{Trade classification algorithms}

The argument \code{algorithm} takes one of four values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Tick"} refers to the tick algorithm: Trade is classified as a
buy (sell) if the price of the trade to be classified
is above (below) the closest different price of a previous trade.
\item \code{"Quote"} refers to the quote algorithm: it classifies a
trade as a buy (sell) if the trade price of the trade to be
classified is above (below) the mid-point of the bid and ask spread.
Trades executed at the mid-spread are not classified.
\item \code{"LR"}  refers to \code{LR} algorithm as in
\insertCite{LeeReady1991;textual}{PINstimation}. It classifies a trade
as a buy (sell) if its price is above (below) the mid-spread (quote
algorithm), and  uses the tick algorithm if the trade price is at
the mid-spread.
\item \code{"EMO"} refers to \code{EMO} algorithm as in
\insertCite{Ellis2000;textual}{PINstimation}.
It classifies trades at the bid (ask) as sells (buys) and uses the tick
algorithm to classify trades within the then prevailing bid-ask spread.
}

\strong{Time lags vs. leads (\code{timelag})}

For the \code{"Quote"}, \code{"LR"} and \code{"EMO"} algorithms, classification relies on a
quote (bid, ask or midquote) matched to each trade. The argument \code{timelag}
controls \emph{when} that quote is taken relative to the trade time:

\itemize{
\item \emph{Positive lags} (\code{timelag > 0}): for a trade at time \code{t}, the
algorithm uses the quote corresponding to the last trade observed
at or before \verb{t - |timelag|} seconds. If no such past trade exists,
the trade has no matched quote.

\item \emph{Zero lag} (\code{timelag = 0}): for a trade at time \code{t}, the algorithm
uses the quote attached to that trade itself, which in the data setup
corresponds to the bid–ask spread just before the trade is executed.

\item \emph{Negative lags / leads} (\code{timelag < 0}): for a trade at time \code{t},
the algorithm uses the quote corresponding to the last trade observed
at or before \verb{t + |timelag|} seconds (a future quote). If no such future trade
exists, the trade has no matched quote.
}

In all cases the time offset is interpreted in seconds as \code{timelag/1e6}.

For example, \code{timelag = 500000} corresponds to 0.5
seconds lag, and \code{timelag = -2000000} corresponds to a 2-second lead.

Trades for which no suitable lagged/leading quote exists within the requested
window are handled as follows:
\itemize{
\item For \code{"Quote"}, the corresponding trades receive \code{NA} classifications.
\item For \code{"LR"}, the quote-based classification is still used where
available; trades exactly at the (lagged/leading) midquote fall back to
the tick rule. When no midquote exists within the window, the result is
\code{NA}.
\item For \code{"EMO"}, the bid/ask from the lagged/leading quote is used when
available. If no such quote exists, the EMO quote-based step is skipped
and the tick rule classification is retained.
}

\code{LR} recommend the use of mid-spread five-seconds earlier ('5-second'
rule) mitigating trade misclassifications for many of the \code{150}
NYSE stocks they analyze. On the other hand, in more recent studies such
as \insertCite{piwowar2006;textual}{PINstimation} and
\insertCite{Aktas2014;textual}{PINstimation}, the use of
1-second lagged midquotes are shown to yield lower rates of
misclassifications. The default value is set to \code{0} seconds (no time-lag).
Considering the ultra-fast nature of today's financial markets, time-lag
is in the unit of milliseconds. Shorter than 1-second lags can also be
implemented by entering values such as  \code{100} or \code{500}.
